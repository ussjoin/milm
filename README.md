# Maternal Integrated Lactation Marker (MILM)

## Purpose

Producing timestamped human breast milk medical labels to apply to milk storage units.

## What? Why?

Everyone who is currently lactating with the intent to feed needs to timestamp milk to ensure it's used oldest-to-newest. (If you need to know why that's important, go Google it.) Some people need to be able to do that *and* apply labels that are readable by a hospital's scanning system.

If you don't need to do the medical thing, then this is probably a bit overkill, but feel free to customize it for your own uses. Replace the barcode with a Star Wars pun!
